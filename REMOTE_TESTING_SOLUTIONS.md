## 🟡 **Option 2: ngrok Tunnels**

### **If You Want to Test Yourself:**

I'll run these commands to make the app accessible:

### **Testing Steps:**
1. Open the frontend URL
2. Test admin login: `admin@heyalec.com` / `admin123`
3. Create a new user account
4. Submit content
5. Switch back to admin view

### **Pros:**
- ✅ You can test at your own pace
- ✅ Full control over testing

### **Cons:**
- ⚠️ Requires technical setup
- ⚠️ URLs change each time
- ⚠️ May have connection issues
